## Diacritizer

In order to improve arabic Text to Speech, we propose to use a diacritizer. Arabic text comes usaully without short vowels, for this reason, we need to add short vowels to it, this process is called diacritizion.

The Idea is to use diacritizer as a wraper, it take text, diacritize it, before passing by the TTS system.

We will use [Mishkal: open source Arabic text diacritizer](http://tahadz.com/mishkal); Mishkal is written by Python langaue, it's open source. it has console, desktop and web interfaces.

We will use i as console command.

To install it, download it from [http://mishkal.sourceforge.net](http://mishkal.sourceforge.net), in many packaging versions for your distribution, or get it from github.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/linuxscout/mishkal.git
```

copy the files into a directory, I choose here to put it in my home user directory

```
/home/me/mishkal-master/
```

You need to install requirments

```
pip install /home/me/mishkal-master/requirements.txt
```



You can test it by python 2.7 or python3


To test it with text

```
$python mishkal-master/bin/mishkal-console.py  "السلام عليكم"
 السِّلَام عَلَيْكُمْ
```


Also, You can run it as web server, this option allow you to run it like the online website

```
$python mishkal-master/interfaces/web/mishkal-webserver.py
serving on 0.0.0.0:8080 view at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Then, run your browser on URL :  [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)


The webserver provide an API, to be used for developement of other apps.

## Integration

Now, we can proceed to integrate Diacritizer with TTS.

First, we test Festival TTS with Mishkal by using pipe

```
$mishkal "مرحبا أهلا بكم" |text2wave -eval "(voice_ara_norm_ziad_hts)" -o /tmp/out.ar_ziad.wav
$play /tmp/out.ar_ziad.wav

```
